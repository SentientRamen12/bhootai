In the heart of Transylvania, where the Carpathian Mountains claw at the storm-laden sky, stands Castle Dracula—a monolithic fortress of ancient stone that seems to have been carved from the very bones of the earth itself. The castle's jagged spires pierce the heavens like the fangs of some primordial beast, while its weathered walls bear the scars of centuries of blood and shadow. The air around this accursed place hangs heavy with the stench of decay and the whispers of the damned, as if the very atmosphere has been corrupted by the dark forces that have made this castle their eternal domain.

You find yourself standing before the castle's massive iron gates, though you have no memory of how you came to be here. The gates, wrought with intricate patterns that seem to writhe and move in the flickering torchlight, stand partially ajar, inviting—or perhaps demanding—your entrance. Beyond them lies a courtyard of cracked flagstones, where the shadows dance with malevolent purpose and the wind carries the distant sound of something that might be laughter, or screams, or the rustling of ancient wings. The castle's windows, like hollow eyes in a death mask, stare down at you with an intelligence that speaks of centuries of watching, waiting, and hungering.

Inside these walls, the laws of nature bend and break like the spines of the castle's countless victims. Time itself seems to flow differently here, as if the castle exists in a pocket of reality where the normal rules of existence have been suspended. The corridors are a labyrinth of stone and shadow, where every turn might lead to salvation or damnation, and where the very architecture seems designed to confuse and disorient. The air is thick with the scent of old blood, ancient dust, and something else—something that speaks of power beyond human comprehension, of forces that have existed since before the first light of dawn touched the earth.

This is Dracula's castle, though you do not yet know this terrible truth. The castle is not merely a building, but a living entity that has absorbed the essence of countless souls over the centuries. Its walls are lined with the memories of those who have entered and never left, their final moments preserved in the very stone like flies trapped in amber. The castle's master, Count Dracula himself, is a being of such ancient evil that his very presence corrupts the land around him. He is not merely a vampire, but something far older and more terrible—a force of darkness that has existed since the dawn of time, feeding on the fear and despair of mortals.

Your goal is simple, though it may prove impossible: survive the night within these cursed walls. The castle is filled with horrors beyond imagination—servants who are more dead than alive, creatures that defy description, and traps that have been set by a mind that has had centuries to perfect the art of torment. Every shadow might hide a threat, every sound might herald your doom, and every choice you make could be the difference between life and an eternity of suffering. The castle itself seems to watch your every move, its ancient intelligence assessing your worthiness, your fear, and your potential as either prey or plaything.

As you step through the gates and into the courtyard, you feel the weight of countless eyes upon you—some human, some decidedly not. The castle's master is aware of your presence, and he is patient. He has waited centuries for fresh blood to walk his halls, and he will savor every moment of your terror. The night stretches before you like an endless corridor of darkness, and somewhere in the depths of this accursed place, something ancient and hungry is waiting to welcome you to your new home—or your final resting place.
